My program: 
1. Echos the rules necessary to create a successful username.
2. Reads user input from variable username.
3. The while loop then checks the username. If the username is all lowercase or contains numbers or contains a "_" AND is between 3 and 12 characters, it is created successfully.
4. However if these conditions are NOT met, the user is asked to re-input the username.
5. The while loop will loop until the conditions from statement 3 are met.
6. Once these conditions are met, the user is thanked, and a username that meets the conditions is saved to the variable username.
